![**Average number of genotyped variants overlapping one variant from the truth set**.
To evaluate the genotyping performance, each genotyped variant is matched to variants in the truth set.
A same variant can match to several variant in the other set because of variant fragmentation or when the truth set contains potentially duplicated SVs.
This x-axis shows the average number of genotyped variants that were matched per truth-set variant.
For example, a value higher than 1 means that variants in the truth were often matched to multiple genotyped variants ("over-genotyping").

![**Overview of the SV evaluation by the *sveval* package**.
For deletions and inversions, we compute the proportion of a variant that is covered by variants in the other set, considering only variants overlapping with at least 10% reciprocal overlap.
A variant is considered true positive if this coverage proportion is higher than 50% and false-positive or false-negative otherwise.
A similar approach is used for insertions, although they are first clustered into pairs located less than 20 bp from each other.
Then their inserted sequences are aligned to derive the coverage statistics.
The SV evaluation approach is described in more detail in the [Methods](#toil-vg-sveval).

#### Variation graph and structural variation
<!-- Careful, we link to this title. If you change it, search and update links -->

A variation graph encodes DNA sequence in its nodes.
Such graphs are bidirected, in that we distinguish between edges incident on the starts of nodes from those incident on their ends.
A path in such a graph is an ordered list of nodes where each is associated with an orientation.
If a path walks from, for example, node A in the forward orientation to node B in the reverse orientation, then an edge must exist from the end of node A to the end of node B.
Concatenating the sequences on each node in the path, taking the reverse complement when the node is visited in reverse orientation, produces a DNA sequence.
Accordingly, variation graphs are constructed so as to encode haplotype sequences as walks through the graph.
Variation between sequences shows up as bubbles in the graph [@tag:snarls].


#### Breakpoint fine-tuning

In addition to genotyping, vg can use an augmentation step to modify the graph based on the read alignment and discover novel variants.
On the simulated SVs, this approach was able to correct many of the 1-10 bp breakpoint errors that were added to the input VCF.
The breakpoints were accurately fine-tuned for 93.8% of the insertions (Fig. {@fig:simerror-bkpt}a and Table {@tbl:simerror-bkpt}).
For deletions, 78.1% of the variants were corrected when only one breakpoint had an error.
In situations where both breakpoints of the deletions were incorrect, only 18.6% were corrected through graph augmentation, and only when the amount of error was small (Fig. {@fig:simerror-bkpt}b).
The breakpoints of less than 20% of the inversions could be corrected.
Across all SV types, the size of the variant didn't affect the ability to fine-tune the breakpoints through graph augmentation (Fig. {@fig:simerror-bkpt}c).

#### Mappability comparison between yeast graphs
<!-- Careful, we link to this title. If you change it, search and update links -->

In order to elucidate whether the *cactus graph* represents the sequence diversity among the yeast strains better than the *VCF graph*, we mapped Illumina short reads to both graphs using `vg map`.
Generally, more reads mapped to the *cactus graph* with high identity (Figs. {@fig:panel3}a and {@fig:panel5}a) and high mapping quality (Figs. {@fig:panel3}b and {@fig:panel5}b) than to the *VCF graph*.
The *VCF graph* exhibited higher mappability only on the reference strain *S.c. S288C* with a marginal difference.
The benefit of using the *cactus graph* is largest for strains in the *S. paradoxus* clade and smaller for strains in the *S. cerevisiae* clade.
We found that the genetic distance to the reference strain (as estimated using Mash v2.1 [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x]) correlated with the increase in confidently mapped reads (mapping quality >= 60) between the *cactus graph* and the *VCF graph* (Spearman's rank correlation, p-value=3.993e-06).
These results suggest that the improvement in mappability is not driven by the higher sequence content in the *cactus graph* alone (16.8 / 15.4 Mb in the *cactus graph* compared to 12.6 / 12.4 Mb in the *VCF graph* for the *all strains set* and the *five strains set*, respectively).
Instead, an explanation could be the construction of the *VCF graph* from a comprehensive but still limited list of variants and the lack of SNPs and small Indels in this list.
Consequently, substantially fewer reads mapped to the *VCF graph* with perfect identity (Figs. {@fig:panel3}a and {@fig:panel5}a, percent identity threshold = 100%) than to the *cactus graph*.
The *cactus graph* has the advantage of implicitly incorporating variants of all types and sizes from the *de novo* assemblies.
As a consequence, the *cactus graph* captures the genetic makeup of each strain more comprehensively and enables more reads to be mapped.

Interestingly, our measurements for the *five strains set* showed only small differences between the five strains that were used to construct the graph and the other seven strains (Fig. {@fig:panel3}).
Only the number of alignments with perfect identity is substantially lower for the strains that were not included in the creation of the graphs (Fig. {@fig:panel3}a).

#### Running time comparison between different tools for HG00514 as genotyped on the HGSVC dataset
<!-- Careful, we link to this title. If you change it, search and update links -->

SMRT-SV v2 Genotyper required roughly 36 hours and 30G ram on 30 cores to genotype the three HGSVC samples on the "SVPOP" VCF.
These numbers are not directly comparable to the above table because 1) they apply to the "SVPOP" rather than "HGSVC" dataset (upon which we were unable to run SMRT-SV v2 Genotyper) and 2) we were unable to install SMRT-SV v2 Genotyper on AWS nodes and ran it on an older, shared server at UCSC instead.

Delly Genotyper, SVTyper and Paragraph start from a set of aligned reads, hence we also show the running time for read alignment with `bwa mem`[@arxiv:1303.3997].

For BayesTyper, the numbers include both khmer counting with kmc and genotyping.
We note that BayesTyper integrated variant calls from GATK haplotypecaller[@doi:10.1038/ng.806] and Platypus[@doi:10.1038/ng.3036], derived from reads mapped with bwa mem[@arxiv:1303.3997].
The numbers shown for BayesTyper does not include this variant discovery pipeline.

Note: toil-vg reserves 200G memory by default for `vg snarls`.  For this graph, about an order of magnitude less was required.  It could have been run on 10 cores on 5 nodes instead.
